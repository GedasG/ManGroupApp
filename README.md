Part 3:
Given a list of words, find a pair of words within it that has a maximal score.

Part 1:
Write a function that will remove a given collection of indices from a list.
Funtion: Utility.removeElements

Part 2:
Write a function that will remove a given collection of index pairs from a list of lists.
